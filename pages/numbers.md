# Numbers

## The **[Number](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Number.html)** Class
The Number class in Java is an _abstract_ class in java from which 10 subclasses inherit to form the Java number system.

Note: In most cases, _primitives_ are used in practical use. The distimction between inherited number classes helps better explain the differences between primitive number types.

There are 10 _subclasses_ of **Number** in Java:

  1. Byte _(8 bit)_
  2. Short _(16 bit)_
  3. Integer _(32 bit)_  
  4. Long _(64 bit)_
  5. Float
  6. Double  
  7. ~~BigDecimal~~ (Not discussed)
  8. ~~BigInteger~~ (Not discussed)
  9. ~~AtomicInteger~~ (Not discussed)
  10. ~~AtomicLong~~ (Not discussed)
